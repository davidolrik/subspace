## Global Flags

| Flag       | Description                                                                                                                              | Default                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `--config` | Path to config file                                                                                                                      | `~/.config/subspace/config.kdl` |
| `--theme`  | CLI color theme override. Built-ins: `dark`, `light`. Any other value loads `~/.config/subspace/themes/<name>.kdl`. See `subspace theme`. | (uses `theme` from config)      |

## `subspace serve`

Starts the proxy server. Loads the config, starts listening for connections, and watches config files for hot-reload.

```sh
subspace serve
subspace serve --config /path/to/config.kdl
```

The server logs its version, listening address, and upstream/route counts on startup. It shuts down gracefully on `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`.

## `subspace status`

Shows health and status of all upstream proxies. Connects to the control socket of a running server.

```sh
subspace status
subspace status -J
```

For each upstream, shows:

- **Health** — TCP connectivity check (OK / FAIL)
- **Type and address** — proxy type and endpoint
- **Latency** — health check round-trip time
- **Traffic stats** — success/failure counts, bytes transferred

Also shows total and active connection counts, and connection pool statistics.

| Flag         | Description     | Default |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------- |
| `-J, --json` | Output raw JSON | `false` |

The built-in `direct` upstream is always listed at the bottom with its traffic stats.

## `subspace resolve <url>`

Shows which route and upstream would handle a given URL. Useful for debugging routing rules without sending actual traffic.

```sh
subspace resolve https://app.corp.internal/api
subspace resolve http://10.0.1.5:8080/health
subspace resolve example.com
```

Accepts a full URL, a `host:port`, or a bare hostname.

Shows:

- The extracted hostname
- The matching route pattern (if any)
- The selected upstream with type and address
- `direct connection` if no route matches

## `subspace top <kind>`

Renders a ranked summary of activity from the persistent statistics database. Reads the same SQLite file that `serve` writes (`<config-dir>/stats.db`), so it works whether or not the proxy is currently running. Three kinds are supported:

- `upstreams` — ranked by per-upstream traffic.
- `domains` — ranked by destination hostname (extracted from Host header / SNI / SOCKS5 destination).
- `routes` — ranked by matched route pattern (`direct` for traffic that didn't match any rule).

```sh
subspace top upstreams                  # default: top 10 by bytes_total over 24h
subspace top domains -w 168h            # busiest hosts over the last 7 days
subspace top routes  -m success -n 5    # routes carrying the most successful conns
subspace top domains -m failures        # hosts that fail most often
subspace top upstreams -J               # JSON for piping into jq / a dashboard
```

| Flag             | Description                                                                    | Default        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `-w, --window`   | Time window (`time.ParseDuration` syntax — `1h`, `24h`, `168h`)                | `24h`          |
| `-m, --metric`   | One of `success`, `failures`, `bytes_in`, `bytes_out`, `bytes_total`           | `bytes_total`  |
| `-n, --limit`    | Maximum number of entries returned                                              | `10`           |
| `-J, --json`     | Emit a JSON envelope (`{kind, metric, window, limit, top: [{name, value}]}`)   | `false`        |

Counters in the database are cumulative since process start, so the value shown is the per-window delta (`MAX − MIN` of the metric over the window). A subspace restart inside the window can cause a small undercount; for long windows that's negligible.

The same data is rendered live on the [statistics page](/guide/pages#statistics-page) under "Top Activity", with the metric selector controlling all three lists at once.

Example:

```text
  Top 2 upstreams by bytes_total over 24h0m0s

   1.  direct  2.1 GiB
   2.  hq      63.1 MiB
```

## `subspace schema`

Prints the embedded KDL schema describing every node, property, and child the config file accepts. Editors with kdl-schema support can use this for completion and validation; for editors without schema support it doubles as a machine-readable reference.

```sh
subspace schema > ~/.config/subspace/subspace.kdl-schema
```

Then point your editor at the file. Most KDL editor extensions look for a `kdl-schema` directive on the first line of the document, so add a comment to the top of your `config.kdl`:

```kdl
// kdl-schema "./subspace.kdl-schema"
```

The same schema is published at [`https://subspace.pub/subspace.kdl-schema`](https://subspace.pub/subspace.kdl-schema), so you can also reference it by URL if your editor supports remote schemas.

## `subspace validate`

Parses the config (main file plus all `include`s and `page` files) and reports any errors without starting the server. Useful for CI on a config repo, or as a pre-commit step.

```sh
subspace validate                         # uses --config or default location
subspace validate --config ./subspace.kdl # validate a specific file
```

Validation runs the same pipeline as `serve`:

- KDL syntax of the main config and every included/page file.
- Cross-references: routes pointing at undefined upstreams, fallbacks differing from `via`, default search engine pointing at a real engine, page tags pointing at the global `tags` block, etc.
- Page KDL parse errors (a broken page is reported and counts as a failure).

Output is a count summary plus either `OK` (exit `0`) or a numbered list of errors (exit `1`):

```text
  config          /home/me/.config/subspace/config.kdl
  files included   12
  upstreams        5
  routes           57
  pages            3
  tags             16
  search engines   8

  OK
```

A failing example:

```text
  1 error(s):
    • route "*.x" references unknown upstream "missing" (route dropped)
```

Wire it into CI as `subspace validate --config path/to/config.kdl`; the non-zero exit on failure is enough to fail the job.

## `subspace theme`

Manages the CLI color theme. The active theme is selected by the [`theme` config key](/reference/configuration#theme) or the `--theme` global flag (the flag wins). Built-ins are `dark` (default) and `light`. Any other name resolves to a file at `~/.config/subspace/themes/<name>.kdl`.

A broken or unresolvable theme never blocks `subspace serve` — it falls back to the dark palette and prints a `theme:` warning under the banner. `subspace validate` surfaces the same warnings as configuration errors.

### `subspace theme export`

Writes a starter theme file to `~/.config/subspace/themes/<name>.kdl`. Edit the file, then reference it from your config with `theme "<name>"`.

```sh
subspace theme export mytheme                        # base on the active palette
subspace theme export --from light pastel            # base on the light built-in
subspace theme export --from dark --force neon       # overwrite an existing file
```

| Flag       | Description                                                | Default                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `--from`   | Base palette to copy from. One of `dark`, `light`.         | the active theme       |
| `--force`  | Overwrite an existing file at the destination path.        | `false`                |

The file contains the full palette with one role-named key per line and a comment for each. All keys are optional; missing keys inherit from the dark built-in. Colors use `#rrggbb` (or `#rgb`).

```kdl
// subspace theme file
heading    "#0a7178"  // section headers, labels, banner accent
success    "#207040"  // OK / healthy / direct
error      "#c24050"  // failures, error markers
// …

bg-success "#dff5e8"  // success badge background
bg-error   "#fde0e6"  // error badge background
// …
```

The full set of role keys is:

| Role                                                                       | Where it appears                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `heading`                                                                  | section headers, labels, banner accent          |
| `success`                                                                  | OK / healthy / `direct` route / success counts  |
| `error`                                                                    | failures, error markers                         |
| `warning`                                                                  | soft warnings (e.g. fallback notes)             |
| `caution`                                                                  | log `WRN` badge                                 |
| `info`                                                                     | log `INF` badge text                            |
| `notice`, `highlight`                                                      | reserved for future use                         |
| `strong`                                                                   | bold high-contrast emphasis (banner)            |
| `faint`                                                                    | barely-visible structural (`=`, separators)     |
| `muted`                                                                    | secondary text (log keys, descriptions)         |
| `body`                                                                     | quiet readable body text                        |
| `bg-success`, `bg-error`, `bg-info`, `bg-warning`, `bg-debug`              | log level badge backgrounds                     |

## `subspace logs`

Streams log output from a running server via the control socket. Shows historical lines first, then optionally follows live output.

```sh
subspace logs                    # last 10 info+ lines
subspace logs -N 50              # last 50 lines
subspace logs -L error           # only errors
subspace logs -L debug -F        # all levels, follow live
```

| Flag           | Description                                         | Default |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-N, --lines`  | Number of historical lines to show                  | `10`    |
| `-L, --level`  | Minimum log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` | `info`  |
| `-F, --follow` | Stream live output after showing history            | `false` |

## `subspace version`

Prints the version and exits.

```sh
subspace version
```
